<H1> <CENTER> BIOLOGY TERM 1 REVISION QUESTION ANSWER </CENTER> </H1>


<H2> 1.     WHAT IS CELL THEORY? EXPLAIN ITS POINTS? </H2>

<H2> ANS. 1839,schleiden and schwann proposed the cell theory.Cell theory is a scientific theory that living organisms are made up of cells
, that they are the basic structural/organizational unit of all organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells.
 Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction.
POINTS OF CELL THEORY STATES THAT:
1. All living organisms are composed of cells.
2.Cell is the fundamental unit of life.
3.All new cells comes from pre-existing cells.
  </H2>
<H2>2.Why we call mitochondria the powerhouse of cell?</h2>
<h2>ANS.Mitochondria are tiny organelles inside cells that are involved in releasing energy from food.
 This process is known as cellular respiration.
 It is for this reason that mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell.
</h2>
<H2>3.Why we call lysosome suicide bag of CELL?</h2>
<h2>ANS.Lysosomes are capable of digesting nucleric acid, polysaccharides, fats and protiens.Along with them lysosomes also digest or damage its own cell 
by its own enzymes which lead to cell death.Hence lysosomes are also called as suicide bag of cell.</h2>

<h2>4.Give the main function of plasma membrane. </h2>
<h2>ANS.The main function of plasma membrane is it regulates the transport of material entering and exiting the cell.</h2>

<h2>5.Classify and explain plant tissue.</h2>
<h2>ANS.Classification of Plant Tissues – Based on its location in the Plant. Epidermal tissues – It covers the outside of a plant in a single layer of cells.
 Ground tissues – It covers the interiors of a plant.
 Vascular tissues – Transports water and dissolved substances inside the plant.</h2>


<h2>6.Difference between 1.xylem and pholem.</h2>
<h2>ANS.1.Xylem and Phloem are two different types of vascular tissues. The main differences between the two is:

Xylem is responsible for transporting water and minerals from roots to other parts of the plant,
 whereas phloem is responsible for transporting food and organic compounds from leaves to other plant parts.


<h2> <center>2.Tendon and ligament</center></h2>
<h2>ANS.A tendon serves to move the bone or structure.
 A ligament is a fibrous connective tissue that attaches bone to bone, 
and usually serves to hold structures together and keep them stable.</h2>


<h2>7.What are connective tissue?Explain the composition of blood.</h2>
<h2>ANS.Connective tissue are type of tissue that binds and supports other tissue of the body.
Connective tissue is made up of cells, fibers, and a gel-like substance.The example of connective tissue include
cartilage,bone,tendon,adipose tissue.</h2>
<H2>Blood has 4 main components:pasma,red blood cells,white blood cells and platelets.</h2>


<h2>8.Write a short note on:</h2>




<h2><center> A. Muscular tissue:</h2>
<h2>=Muscular tissue is a specialized tissue in animals which applies forces to different parts of the body by contraction. It is made up of thin and elongated cells called muscle fibers.
It controls the movement of an organism.

<h2><center>B.Areolar tissue:</center></h2>
<h2>=The areolar tissue is a loose connective tissue that can be seen between the 
skin and muscles; in the bone marrow as well as around the blood vessels and nerves.</h2>


<h2><center>C.Cartilage tissue:</center></h2>
<h2>=Cartilage is a non-vascular type of supporting connective tissue that is found 
throughout the body . Cartilage is a flexible connective tissue that differs from bone 
in several ways;
 it is avascular and its microarchitecture is less organized than bone.</h2>

<h2><CENTER>D. Nervous tissue:</CENTER></h1>
<h2>=Nervous tissue is found in the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
 It is responsible for coordinating and controlling many body activities.
 It stimulates muscle contraction, creates an awareness of the environment,
 and plays a major role in emotions, memory, and reasoning.</H2>


<H2>9.Explain the structure of function of epithilial tissue.</h2>
<h2>ANS.Epithelial tissues are widespread throughout the body.
 They form the covering of all body surfaces, line body cavities and hollow organs, and are
 the major tissue in glands. 
They perform a variety of functions that include protection, secretion, absorption, excretion, filtration, diffusion,
 and sensory reception.</h2>

<h2>10.Find differences between</h2>
<h2> <center> Chronic and Acute disease </center></h2>
<h2>=Acute illnesses generally develop suddenly and last a short time, often only a few days or weeks.
 Chronic conditions develop slowly and may worsen over an extended period of time—months to years.</H2>

<H2><CENTER> Infectious and Non-Infectious disease </center></h2>
<h2>=Infectious diseases are transmitted from person-to-person through the transfer of a pathogen such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. A non-infectious disease cannot be transmitted through a pathogen and is caused by a variety of other circumstantial factors.</h2>

<h1>11.Give 2 example of each:</h1>

<h2><center>Chronic disease </center><h2>
<h2> 1.CANCER 2.HEART DISEASE </h2>

<h2><center> Bacterial disease</center></h2>

<h2> 1.CHOLERA 2.DIPTHERIA </h2>

<H2><CENTER>Viral disease </center></h2>

<h2> 1.AIDS 2.CHICKENPOX </H2>



<h2><center>Protozoa</CENTER></H2>

<H2> 1.MALARIA 2.TOXOPLASMOSIS </H2>

<H2><CENTER>Fungus disease</CENTER></H2>

<h2> 1.RINGWORM 2.YEAST INFECTION </h2>

<h2>12.What is AIDS?Explain its causes sympton and precaution.</h2>
<h2>ANS.Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS(It spread by HIV)its infective human immune system.Its cronic and infectious disease.
<H2><center>CAUSES</CENTER></H2>
<H2>1.Unprotected sexual intercourse.</H2>
<H2>2.Through bloof transmission.</H2>
<H2>3.Infected injection.</H2>
<H2>4.From infected mother to childer.</H2>
<H2><center>SYMPTONS</CENTER></H2>
<H2>1.Immune system getting weak day by day.</H2>
<H2>2.Weight loss.</H2>
<H2>Sweat during sleep.</H2>
<H2><center>PREVENTION</CENTER></H2>
<H2>Always keep protected sex honest to 1 partner.</H2>


<H2>13.What are symptons of disease?Explain.</H2>
<h2>There are many symptons of disease.Every disease has different symptons.1.FEVER 2.DIARRHEA 3.COLD 4.MUSCLE ACHES 5.HEADACHE 6.COUGHING 7.PROBLEM IN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.</h2>

<h2>14.What are means of spread?</h2>
<H2>ANS.Infectious diseases spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air, water, food,vectors, physical contact and sexual contact.</h2>
